# Plutonium: Black ops II Mapvote
Developed by @DoktorSAS

Several Servers Owners require a mapvote for their quality servers. This mapvote is the ideal script considering its ease of use. In fact to use it you just have to modify some dvar in your .cfg file and you will be able to customize the mapvote according to your preferences.

### Installation Guide

There is no video tutorial on how to install mapvote, it will be done in the future. 
However, all the necessary information has been written. Reading it is enough to make the script work.

    1. Download the files from the [github release]()
    2. Copy the file _mapvote.gsc_ in your scripts folder (by default is  _%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\mp_)
    3. Open your server config file (The _.cfg_ file) and copy and paste the content of _config.cfg_
    4. Edit your maprotation and set just one map like _`set sv_maprotation "map mp_nuketown_2025"`_
    5. Start the server!
