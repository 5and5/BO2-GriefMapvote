# Black ops II Mapvote Menu
**Mapvote v1.0.4**
Developed by **DoktorSAS**

Hi I am **DoktorSAS** and I wanted to release the *working mapvote* on the endgame, in order to release it I need to do some tests and that's why I ask you to enter my server. 
**Tutorial**
1. Edit the file **_killcam_not_compiled.gsc** and change only the Welcome Message
2. Convert the file into a new **_killcam.gsc**, is important call it **_killcam.gsc**
3. Put the file into **maps/mp/gametpyes**
4. Change the **sv_maprotation** to only one map *(exemple sv_maprotation "map mp_carrier")*
