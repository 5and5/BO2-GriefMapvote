How to use the script?
    To use the script, just copy the compiled mapvote.gsc 
    file into the folder %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\mp\

Does it work in a private game?
    The script is made to be Server Side and work with map rotation. Private games 
    do not support map rotation and therefore the script cannot work if no changes are made.

is it allowed to sell/share the script?
    You are allowed to share the script but you are not allowed to sell or resell it. Since 
    this is an open source project, selling even a slightly modified script is considered fraud.
    P.S: 
        I am not respnsible for what will be done, it just bothers me the resale of free stuff.
    
Who can I contact for support?
    In case of support you just write under the post on the forum.

Does it work on Console and Redacted T6?
    It doesn't work without modifications, to make it work you have to modify 
    the code that handles the pressed buttons.
